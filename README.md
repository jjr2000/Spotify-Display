# Archived

This project has been archived for now as it requires a complete rewrite to work with spotifys updated API.

Due to my time avalibility this will not be happening for the foreseable.

Spotify also now has a fullscreen mode making this need for this library much less important.

# Spotify Display

Spotify display is a small program designed to enhance the desktop experience of spotify for communal purposes.
